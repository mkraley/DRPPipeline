# Run All Tests After Each Code Change

After **every** code change (edit, new file, or refactor), you **must** run the full test suite and ensure it passes before considering the response complete.

## What to do

1. After making code changes, run all tests from the project root:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Documents\Code\DRPPipeline; python -m pytest -v
   ```
2. If any test fails, fix the code or tests until the suite passes.
3. Do not leave the user with failing tests or skip running tests "for them to run later."

## Scope

- Run the **entire** test suite (`pytest` with no path), not only the file or module you changed.
- Use Windows/PowerShell syntax (e.g. `;` to chain commands if needed).

This ensures regressions and errors (e.g. missing helpers, broken imports) are caught immediately.
