# Standing Instructions for CDC Data Collector Project

## Code Style & Conventions
- use python 13
- target windows 11
- use playwright for automating access to web pages
- Use Windows path syntax for file paths (backslashes, drive letters)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Prefer descriptive variable names
- CSV and other text-based files are UTF-8-sig encoded
- keep methods short. Each method should do one thing only
- Use python classes and inheritance where appropriate
- segregate code in multiple files rather than creating very large source files. Typically only one class per file.
- Don't Repeat Yourself - look for duplicate (or almost duplicate) code and combine them into common methods or utility functions.

## Debugging
- when agent creates temp files for debugging, keep them and any output files they generate in a separate folder, e.g. debug

## Source control
- at each iteration of the chat, prepare a commit with all changed files and a suggested commit comment.

## Testing
- create unit tests as code is developed. Keep tests up to date.
- store test code in parallel files, e.g. test_xxx.py

## Logging
- use standard log levels: debug, info, warning, error

## Input parameters and configuration
- use command line parameters for any configuration-type parameters with suitable defaults
- allow use of a config file to hold parameters. config file is overridable by command line args

## Project-Specific Guidelines


## Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages with context
- Use try/except blocks for file operations and network requests
- Log errors but don't crash the entire process unless necessary
- Use exceptions for fatal errors

## Testing & Validation
- Validate URLs before processing
- Check file existence before operations
- Handle missing columns in CSV/Excel files gracefully, but warn the user

## Documentation
- Update README.md when adding new features or changing behavior
- Include examples in docstrings showing how to use functions

## Dependencies
- Keep requirements.txt up to date
- Note: This code is written by Cursor/Claude (as noted in README)

## Database
- Use SQLite with WAL mode for shared database access

## File Organization
- Keep utility functions in separate modules (e.g., url_id_utils.py, shared_db.py)
