Thoughts on restructuring

Modules
  Sourcing - what projects to process
    obtain from master spreadsheet, e.g. DRP Data_Inventories
    create database record and generate ID
    duplicate prevention
    check for source URL existence
  Collectors
    pre-process HTML, eg. expand "read more"
    Harvest metadata
    post-process metadata
    HTML to PDF
    download files
  Intermediate storage
    files
    metadata
    progress/status
    API
  Uploading
    create project
    upload files
    metadata
    double check completion
  Publication
  Add to U.S. Government Web & Data Archive
  Update master spreadsheet

Storage schema
  DRPID - 6 digit int which is a hash of the source URL.
  source_url
  folder_path - used to store all files for the project
  title - string with user readable project title
  agency
  office
  summary
  keywords - comma delimited strings
  time_start
  time_end
  data_types
  download_date
  collection_notes
  file_size
  datalumos_id
  published_url
  status - latest step completed? or individual fields for each task
